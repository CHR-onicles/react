# Tokens

A Token represents a piece of data. They are typically used to show a collection of related attributes.

The default `Token` can be used for most cases, but specialized token components are provided for specific use cases (see below for more info).

All types of tokens may have the same interactive qualities as links or buttons. They also have a sense of being "selected" and ready for user interaction such as being removed from a collection.

## Token

The default `Token` component

### Basic example
<!-- insert example of plain token that just has text -->
```tsx live
```

### With a `leadingVisual`
<!-- insert example of plain token that has an icon as the leadingVisual -->
```tsx live
```

### Interactive token examples
<!--
insert multiple examples:
- link
- button
- with internal remove button
- selectable
-->
```tsx live
```

## Component props
<!-- insert prop table here -->

## TokenLabel

Tokens that represent Issue Labels should use the `TokenLabel` component.

<!-- insert row of issue labels -->
```tsx live
```

## TokenProfile

Tokens that represent GitHub users should use the `TokenProfile` component.

<!-- insert row of profile tokens -->
```tsx live
```
