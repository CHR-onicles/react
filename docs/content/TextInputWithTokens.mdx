# TextInputWithTokens

A `TextInputWithTokens` component is used to show multiple values in one field.

It supports all of the features of a [TextInput]() component, but it can render a list of [Tokens]() next to the area a user types in.

## Basic Example

<!-- insert topic tags input? -->
```tsx live
```

## Adding and removing tokens

The array passed to the `tokens` prop needs to be manually updated to add and remove tokens.

The function passed to the `onRemoveToken` prop is called when:
- Clicking the remove button in the token
- Pressing the `Backspace` key when the input is empty
- Selecting a token using the arrow keys or by clicking on a token and then pressing the `Backspace` key

There is no function that gets called to "add" a token, so the user needs to be provided with a UI to select tokens.

For example, an [Autocomplete]() component may be used to select tokens:
<!-- insert editable topic tags input? -->
```tsx live
```

## Custom token rendering

By default, the `Token` input is used to render the tokens in the input. If this component does not make sense for the kinds of tokens you're rendering, you can pass a component to the `tokenComponent` prop

For example, a `TextInputWithTokens` that shows selected Issue Labels could use a [TokenLabel]():
<!-- insert input that has issue label tokens passed -->
```tsx live
```

## Component props

<!-- insert prop table here -->
